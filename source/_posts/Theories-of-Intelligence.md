# <font color=purple>*Alan Turing, [Intelligent Machinery](https://github.com/hengjiwang/casual_readings/raw/master/Alan_Turing_Intelligent_Machinery_1948.pdf), 1948.*</font>

## Feasibility of intelligent machinery
- Reasons that people feel intelligent machinery is impossible:
  - (a) unwilling to adimit that mankind can be superseded
  - (b) religious belief
  - (c) machinery can only do straight-forward or repetive jobs
  - (d) machinery is unable to determine the truth/falsity of math theorems without making mistakes
  - (e) machine can show nothing but a reflection of the intelligence of its creator

- Turing's refutations:
  - Turing refused to refute (a) and (b)
  - (c) Acutual existence of machinery that can do $10^{60000}$ operations without repetition
  - (d) Not making mistakes is not a requirement for intelligence
  - (e) machine can do more (like playing chess)

## Varieties of machinery

_discrete and continuous_; _controlling and active_

- Logical computing machines(LCMs)
  - tape form storage of information
  - can do anything that could be described as 'purely mathematical'
- Practical computing machines(PCMs)
  - address-to-position form storage of information
  - can do whatever LCMs can do
- Paper machines
  - a machine that can carry out things provided with written instructions
- Partially random and apparently partially random machines
  - allow several randomly alternative operations at some points
  - opposite to deterministic
- **Unorganised machines**
  - largely random in their construction
  - made up unsystematicly from some kind of standard components
    - A-type machines: behave a complicated manner when number of units is large
    - B-type machines: with inteference inputs
    - P-type machines

## Interference with machinery

- Merely infers to "_interfere by communication of information to thr machine_"
- Machine is **modifiable**
- Machine can **modify itself**, whenever the content of this storage was altered by the
internal operations of the machine

## Man as a machine

- human is a thinking machine.
- To build a human as thinking machine, suitable branches are:
  - games e.g. chess, bridge, poker
  - learning of languages
  - translation of languages
  - cryptography
  - mathematics

## Education of machinery

- Humans are growing with education
- For machinery we should start with little capacity to carry out elaborate operations but give a huge capacity for educating them by appropriate interference. 

## The cortex as an unorganised machine
- brain is indeterministic, thus different **trainings** result in different results
- consider genetics and evolution 

## Experiments in organizing: pleasure–pain systems

- Training of human child depends largely on rewards (R) and punishments (P), which we can also use on machinery. 
- Pain stimuli occur when the machine’s behaviour is wrong, pleasure stimuli when it is particularly right.

## Discipline and initiative

- After a long time of discipline, the machine might be able to make decisions or choices, which we call it has initiative.

- search for new techniques must be regarded as carried out by the human community as a whole, rather than by individuals
