## Feasibility of intelligent machinery
- Reasons that people feel intelligent machinery is impossible:
  - (a) unwilling to adimit that mankind can be superseded
  - (b) religious belief
  - (c) machinery can only do straight-forward or repetive jobs
  - (d) machinery is unable to determine the truth/falsity of math theorems without making mistakes
  - (e) machine can show nothing but a reflection of the intelligence of its creator

- Turing's refutations:
  - Turing refused to refute (a) and (b)
  - (c) Acutual existence of machinery that can do $10^{60000}$ operations without repetition
  - (d) Not making mistakes is not a requirement for intelligence
  - (e) machine can do more (like playing chess)

## Varieties of machinery

_discrete and continuous_; _controlling and active_

- Logical computing machines(LCMs)
  - tape form storage of information
  - can do anything that could be described as 'purely mathematical'
- Practical computing machines(PCMs)
  - address-to-position form storage of information
  - can do whatever LCMs can do
- Paper machines
  - a machine that can carry out things provided with written instructions
- Partially random and apparently partially random machines
  - allow several randomly alternative operations at some points
  - opposite to deterministic

## Unorganised machines
