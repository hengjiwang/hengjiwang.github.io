# <font color = purple>*Stanislaw Lem, Intellectronics – [The Ghost in the Machine, pages 129-153](https://intelligentmachinerycourse.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/stanislas_lem_intelectronics_3of3_p.pdf), 1964*</font>

- Information exists when there are no intelligent beings
- A symbol can be a thing, yet it does not refer to this thing but to something else
- A carrier of information about something is not the symbol of that thing (e.g. gene and blue eyes)
- Information only exists in the context of a given set within which one is making a selection
- Information obtained is not a reflection of the actual state of things (the world) but rather a function of this state -- a function whose values depend both on Nature and on the frame of reference provided by man
- Perceptrons may take us closer to understanding intuition
- Whether products of “machinic thinking” can go beyond the limits of man’s intellectual capacity?
  - Can human fully understand the theories machines invent (is human's brain capacity enough)? No -- scientists and common people
  - Can human grasp machines if they are more intelligent than human? No
- Machines may become nonhuman regulators and form a homeostatic internal systems, to which we shall have to allow for thorough control and intervention to be enacted by the intelelectronic regulators.
- Final decisions will remain in human hands and machine regulators only give advice because they will not have signs of egoism or a desire for power. (Really?)
