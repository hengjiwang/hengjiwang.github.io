- **Thoughts have connections**
  - thought-of?
    - cannot be formulated simply
    - every conceivable connection can be thought-of (succession, coexistence, resemblance, contrast ... )
    - proceed from one thought to the other by some intelligible path
  - between thoughts?
- **What determines the particular path?**
  - countless of reasons
  - mode of genesis
- Habit is a sufficient explanation of the sequence of our thoughts
- **Objects are associated, not ideas**
  - association stands for a _cause_, between _processes_ in the brain
  - association determines what successive objects shall be thought
- **The elementary principle**
  - no other elementary causal law than the law of neural habit
  - _When two elementary brain-processes have been active together or in immediate succession, one of them tends to propagate its excitement into the other._
  - _The amount of activity at any given point in the braincortex is the sum of the tendencies of all other points to discharge into it._
- **Spontaneous trains of thought**
  - behind an object there is a combination of objects associated
- **Total recall**
  - _All revivals of a past experience together determine the next thought._
- **Partial recall**
  - _some one brain-process is always prepotent above its concomitants in arousing action elsewhere._
  - **Which associates come up in partial recall?**
    - habit (frequency)
    - recency
    - vividness
    - emotional congruity
- **Focalized recall, or association by similarity**
  - _A small surviving portion will surround itself with its own associates though other portions of the object have faded._
  - _the relation between the new thoughtâ€™s object and the object of the faded thought will be a relation of similarity._
  - When we affirm the similarity of two compound things, we should always say in what respect it obtains.
- **Voluntary trains of thought**
  - _voluntary:_ describing a process of suggestion of one object by another to be spontaneous
- **Problems**
  - _problem:_ the search for _means_ by which the _end_ shall be attained
  - _end:_ which we desire before we have attained it
  - e.g. mode of recalling a thing forgotten
- **Solution**
  - _will:_  _to emphasize and linger over those which seem pertinent, and ignore the rest_
  - Try to find everything that is associated with the object we desire to recall.
- **Similarity no elementary law**
  - object called up may bear any logical relation whatever to the one which suggested it
  - The similarity itself between the objects has no causal agency in carrying us from one to the other. It is but a result (agent).
